Hello! Thank you for liking my website! I hope you can support me by giving me a follow! 

Anyways, here are some tips on how to deploy the website. 
1) Create an account on github and create a repository
2) Copy the code from index.html and page2.html and paste this into your own repository
3) Make sure to change the name of the branch from "main" to "master"
4) Things you'll need to change, page 1: message to your partner, background, gif, and the link to page2 (my page2 link is specific to me, so change it to your personal link) Page 2: background, gif, and personal message when the person clicks yes.
5) after pubslishing the pages and changing the info in each page, go to settings in your repository, click on pages, and click branch and save (if confused watch
the video I put below) then after a few mintues a link to a website should come up on the page. That is the link you can share to your valentine. 

If you're having any trouble, chatgpt is really helpful.
